# Benchmarks

Set of latency benchmarks testing round trip time (RTT) between threads or processes via FIFO data structures.

## Java Benchmarks

To run the Java benchmarks execute the Gradle script in the base directory.

    $ ./gradlew
    
    $ ./gradlew runJavaBenchmarks

or just the Aeron benchmarks

    $ ./gradlew runAeronJavaBenchmarks

## C++ Benchmarks

To generate the benchmarks, execute the `cppbuild` script from the base directory.

    $ cppbuild/cppbuild

To run the benchmarks, execute the individual benchmarks.

    $ cppbuild/Release/binaries/baseline
    $ cppbuild/Release/binaries/aeronExclusiveIpcBenchmark
    $ cppbuild/Release/binaries/aeronIpcBenchmark
    $ cppbuild/Release/binaries/aeronExclusiveIpcNanomark
    $ cppbuild/Release/binaries/aeronIpcNanomark

**Note**: On MacOS, it will be necessary to set `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` for the Aeron
driver shared library. For example:

    $ env DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=cppbuild/Release/aeron-prefix/src/aeron-build/lib cppbuild/Release/binaries/aeronIpcBenchmark

The binaries with __Benchmark__ in the name use Google Benchmark and only displays average times.

While the binaries with __Nanomark__ in the name use Nanomark (included in the source) and displays full histograms.

To pick a specific tag for Aeron, specify `--aeron-git-tag` parameter when invoking `cppbuild` script.
For example:
```bash
cppbuild/cppbuild --aeron-git-tag="1.27.0"
```
will use Aeron `1.27.0` release.
